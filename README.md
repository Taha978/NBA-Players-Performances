## NBA Player Performance Metrics Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the performance metrics of current NBA players. The workflow consists of several key steps, outlined below:

#### 1. Scraping Player Names 
The first step involves scraping the names of active NBA players from the official NBA website. This is performed in the notebook Scraping Players Names from NBA Website.ipynb.

#### 2. Collecting Performance Metrics
Once the players' names are obtained, the next step is to gather their current performance metrics by scraping data from each player's Wikipedia page. This process is detailed in Wikipedia Scraping.ipynb.

#### 3. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
The collected data is saved in JSON format. To ensure consistency, cleaning and pre-processing techniques are applied to standardize the data for all players into a unified dataframe. The corresponding steps can be found in Data Cleaning & Pre-processing.ipynb.

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With the cleaned data, exploratory data analysis is conducted to compare performance metrics across different categories of players. This analysis provides insights into patterns and trends in player performance.
